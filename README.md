# SHELL-interaction
Expect command or expect scripting language is a language that talks with your interactive programs or scripts that require user interaction.

Expect scripting language works by expecting input, then the Expect script will send the response without any user interaction.

You can say that this tool is your robot which will automate your scripts.

What Expect Can Do

For example, here are some things the expect command can do:

Cause your computer to dial you back so that you can log in without paying for the call.
Start a game and if the optimal configuration doesn't appear, restart it again and again) until it does, and then hand over control to you.
Run fsck, and in response to its questions, answer "yes" or "no" or give control back to you, based on predetermined criteria.
Connect to another network and automatically retrieve your mail so that it appears as if it was originally sent to your local system.
Carry environment variables, current directory, or any kind of information across rlogin, telnet, tip, su, or chgrp
